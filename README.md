# Small C Programs

## Description
This repository contains a collection of small programs written in the C programming language. Each of these programs is designed to solve a specific problem, demonstrate various programming concepts, or simply serve as a practice exercise in C.

## Repository Structure
Each program is located in a separate folder that includes:
- A `.c` source file
- A `README.md` file with a brief description of the program
- (Optional) Input and output files, if needed

## Getting Started
To compile and run any of the programs, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the directory of the program you want to run.
2. Compile the source file using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`):
   ```bash
   gcc -o program_name program_name.c
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

## Prerequisites
To compile and run these programs, you will need:
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A terminal or command-line interface

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this repository, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request with your improvements or additional programs. Please make sure your code is well-documented and follows the same structure as the existing programs.
